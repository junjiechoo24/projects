In this project, we'll explore the effectiveness of deep, feedforward neural networks at classifying images, we'll gradually build a neural network by adding hidden layers and by testing with differents models. We will also compare neural networks with K-NearestNeighbours and Decision Tree models. The features in an image don't have an obvious linear or nonlinear relationship that can be learned with a model like linear or logistic regression. In grayscale, each pixel is just represented as a brightness value ranging from 0 to 256. Scikit-learn contains a number of datasets pre-loaded with the library, within the namespace of sklearn.datasets. The load_digits() function returns a copy of the hand-written digits dataset from UCI. 

Conclusion: Deep learning is effective in image classification because of the models' ability to learn hierarchical representations. At a high level, an effective deep learning model learns intermediate representations at each layer in the model and uses them in the prediction process.
