This figure compares between Italy and South Korea. It catches peopleâ€™s eyes because this may show that there can be a lot of infected young people in Italy that are missed as they show no or mild symptoms, and they may spread the virus to others unconsciously. As pointed out in the source report, Italy has predominantly been testing people with symptoms of a coronavirus infection, while South Korea has been testing basically everyone since the outbreak had become apparent. Consequently, South Korea has detected more asymptomatic, but positive cases of coronavirus than Italy, in particular among young people.

However, looking at Figure 1 alone is not enough to get the above conclusion as the age structure in the two countries are also different. Even if both two countries can diagnoses every effected case, you would see a higher fraction of elder people diagnosed in Italy than in South Korea since Italy has one of the oldest populations in the world.

If Italy has missed a lot of younger patients who have no or milder symptoms, we can give an estimate of how many people are actually infected in Italy at this moment using logistic regression.
